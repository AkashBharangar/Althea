# Althea

**Full-stack web app for emotional language patterns in journal-style text—sentence-level sentiment, trigger-style themes, and observational reflections. Built with open-source NLP (no paid LLM APIs).**

---

## Overview

People often write to understand a day, not to be “fixed.” Althea is built for that habit: you paste or type text, and the app summarizes how sentiment moves through sentences, which topics tend to sit next to lower scores, and a few neutral mirror-style lines that describe what showed up in the language itself.

It is **not** a clinical or therapeutic product. It does not interpret your mental state, predict outcomes, or tell you what to do. It stays inside the text: counts, patterns, and careful wording that avoids advice and diagnosis.

## Key Features

- **Sentence-level sentiment** — A simple polarity timeline across the piece you submitted, so you can see where the language brightens or dims.
- **Trigger-style ranks** — Nouns and phrases surfaced from the text, scored in relation to sentiment (topics that more often appear near lower-scoring sentences). Useful as a starting point for your own reflection, not as a label of “what is wrong.”
- **Observational reflections** — Short, template-grounded lines that describe patterns in the writing (e.g., balance of positive and negative sentences, volatility). They are descriptive, not prescriptive.
- **Calm UI** — A restrained interface meant to feel like a quiet studio, not a dashboard for a crisis service.

---

## Design Principles

- **Non-clinical** — No symptom language, no “you should,” no implied expertise about your life.
- **Transparency** — The pipeline is rule- and library-based; there is no hidden model vendor or black-box scoring you cannot reason about at a high level.
- **Low pressure** — Copy and layout favor clarity and breathing room over urgency, streaks, or gamification.
- **Honest scope** — The app shows what the algorithms can see in text, and stops there.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choices |
|--------|---------|
| **Frontend** | React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Recharts |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express |
| **NLP** | [`sentiment`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sentiment) (polarity), [`compromise`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compromise) (lightweight NLP / keyword-style extraction) |
| **APIs** | None required for analysis; no OpenAI or other paid inference endpoints in the core path |

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+ and npm.

1. **Clone the repository** and open the project root.

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run install:all
   (install:all installs frontend and backend packages.)

Environment files

Copy backend/.env.example to backend/.env and adjust if needed. For local dev, CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173 is typical.
Optionally copy frontend/.env.example to frontend/.env. For local development you can leave VITE_API_URL unset; Vite proxies /api to the backend (see frontend/vite.config.js).
Run both apps
npm run dev
Frontend: http://localhost:5173
Backend: default port 8787 (or PORT from backend/.env)
Build (production-style)

npm run build
API quick check

Health: GET /api/health
Analyze: POST /api/analyze with JSON body { "text": "Your journal or chat excerpt here." } (max length enforced in backend/src/routes/analyze.js).
System Flow
The browser sends the user’s text to the API.
The backend splits the text into sentences and scores each with the sentiment lexicon.
Compromise helps extract noun-like cues; those are ranked against sentence scores to highlight recurring themes that skew with lower sentiment.
A small reflection layer turns aggregate metrics into fixed, observational templates (no free-form generative “advice”).
The frontend renders a timeline, tags, and cards from that structured JSON.
Deployment
Frontend (Vercel): Set the project root to frontend. Build: npm run build, output: dist. Set VITE_API_URL to your public API URL (no trailing slash).
Backend (Render): Root directory backend; npm install and npm start. Set CLIENT_ORIGIN to your Vercel origin(s). Optional: ALLOW_VERCEL_PREVIEWS=1 for *.vercel.app previews. Health check path: /api/health.
Step-by-step notes live in DEPLOYMENT.md.

Limitations
English-centric — The compromise pipeline and sentiment lexicon are oriented toward English; other languages will not behave reliably.
Lexicon sentiment is shallow — Sarcasm, mixed emotions, and domain-specific nuance are easy to misread.
Triggers are statistical, not causal — A word appearing near lower scores is correlation in this text, not proof of a life pattern.
No accounts or persistence in the current shape — text is processed for the request; long-term storage is a product decision you would add explicitly.
Not for emergencies — If someone is at risk, they need real people and professional help, not an app.
Roadmap
Optional auth and encrypted storage for people who want history on their own terms.
Stronger linguistic handling (negation, contrast, longer documents) within the same “no advice” boundary.
Export (e.g., Markdown/PDF) for personal archives.
Accessibility pass (motion-reduced paths, screen reader tuning).
Automated tests around the analyze pipeline and API contracts.
Ethical Positioning
Althea is a language mirror, not a caregiver.

It must not present itself as therapy, counseling, or medical care.
It must not output diagnosis, treatment suggestions, or instructions about medication, relationships, or safety decisions.
It should use neutral, observational language and invite the human to decide what, if anything, the output means for them.
Anyone shipping a fork for real users should add clear disclaimers, age-appropriate flows where relevant, and a path to human crisis resources where the law or context requires it.
If you extend the product, keep the boundary between describing text and directing a life explicit in both UX and copy.

Why This Project Matters
Althea is a full-stack exercise in building something people might actually open when they are tired: fast feedback loops, honest limits, and deployment to real hosts. It shows comfort with React and modern tooling, a small but coherent API design, and integration of open-source NLP without outsourcing judgment to a proprietary chat model. For teams that care about responsible product framing, the README and the code are meant to read as intentional, not accidental.

Contributing
Issues and pull requests are welcome. Please keep changes aligned with the non-clinical, non-advisory positioning. For larger features, open an issue first so scope and ethics constraints stay aligned.

License
MIT — add a LICENSE file (for example, the standard MIT license text) so the terms match how you distribute the code.
